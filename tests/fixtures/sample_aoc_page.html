        <h2>--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---</h2>
        <p>
          The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh
          launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was
          visiting locations that are historically significant to the North
          Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as
          they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a
          <em>star</em>. They figure the Chief Historian
          <strong>must</strong> be in one of the first fifty places they'll
          look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get
          <strong>fifty stars</strong> on their list before Santa takes off on
          December 25th.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available
          on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when
          you complete the first. Each puzzle grants <strong>one star</strong>.
          Good luck!
        </p>
        <p>
          You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians
          has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is
          currently <em>empty</em>. Eventually, someone decides that the best
          place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief
          Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover
          an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant
          locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing
          before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which
          locations to search?
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations
          are listed not by name but by a unique number called the
          <em>location ID</em>. To make sure they don't miss anything, The
          Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying
          to create their own complete list of location IDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up
          <em>side by side</em> (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear
          that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians
          reconcile their lists?
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up
          the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the
          <em>smallest number in the left list</em> with the
          <em>smallest number in the right list</em>, then the
          <em>second-smallest left number</em> with the
          <em>second-smallest right number</em>, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within each pair, figure out <em>how far apart</em> the two numbers
          are; you'll need to <em>add up all of those distances</em>. For
          example, if you pair up a <code>3</code> from the left list with a
          <code>7</code> from the right list, the distance apart is
          <code>4</code>; if you pair up a <code>9</code> with a <code>3</code>,
          the distance apart is <code>6</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The smallest number in the left list is <code>1</code>, and the
            smallest number in the right list is <code>3</code>. The distance
            between them is <code>2</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second-smallest number in the left list is <code>2</code>, and
            the second-smallest number in the right list is also <code>3</code>.
            The distance between them is <code>1</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The third-smallest number in both lists is <code>3</code>, so the
            distance between them is <code>0</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So, for these example lists, the total distance is
          <code>2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5</code> = <strong><code>11</code></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs.
          <em>What is the total distance between your lists?</em>
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="day-desc">
        <h2>--- Part Two ---</h2>
        <p>
          Your analysis only confirmed what everyone feared: the two lists of
          location IDs are indeed very different.
        </p>
        <p>Or are they?</p>
        <p>
          The Historians can't agree on which group made the mistakes
          <em>or</em> how to read most of the Chief's handwriting, but in the
          commotion you notice an interesting detail: a lot of location IDs
          appear in <em>both</em> lists! Maybe the other numbers aren't location
          IDs at all but rather misreadings of the Chief's handwriting?
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number
          from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total
          <em>similarity score</em> by adding up each number in the left list
          after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the
          right list.
        </p>
        <p>Here are the same example lists again:</p>
        <pre><code>3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
</code></pre>
        <p>
          For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity
          score:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first number in the left list is <code>3</code>. It appears in
            the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by
            <code>3 * 3 = <strong>9</strong></code
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second number in the left list is <code>4</code>. It appears in
            the right list once, so the similarity score increases by
            <code>4 * 1 = <strong>4</strong></code
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            The third number in the left list is <code>2</code>. It does not
            appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase
            (<code>2 * 0 = <strong>0</strong></code
            >).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this
          process is <code>9 + 4 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 9</code> =
          <strong><code>31</code></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again consider your left and right lists.
          <em>What is their similarity score?</em>
