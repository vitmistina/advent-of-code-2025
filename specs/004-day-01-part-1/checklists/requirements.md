# Specification Quality Checklist: Day 1 Part 1 Solution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: December 1, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: PASSED ✓

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

- Spec contains no implementation details (no languages, frameworks, or APIs mentioned)
- All requirements are testable and technology-agnostic
- 12 detailed acceptance scenarios cover the complete example from the puzzle description
- Edge cases are identified and documented
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope is clearly bounded to counting zero positions after rotations

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
