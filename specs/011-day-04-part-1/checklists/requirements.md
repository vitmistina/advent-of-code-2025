# Specification Quality Checklist: Day 4 Part 1 - Accessible Paper Rolls Counter

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Initial Validation (2025-12-04)**:

- All checklist items pass
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All requirements are testable (e.g., "System MUST produce the correct answer of 13 for the provided example grid")
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "System produces the correct answer of 13 accessible paper rolls")
- Edge cases comprehensively covered (empty grid, single roll, boundary conditions)
- Assumptions clearly documented (rectangular grid, well-formed input, accessibility threshold)
- User stories are properly prioritized and independently testable

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING - No issues found, proceed to `/speckit.plan`
